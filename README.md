----------------------------------------------------------------

SMEW Ship Radio Info Editor is a hack heavily based off the Newer Credits Editor tool(http://newerteam.com/wii/).

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Getting Started

If you're on Windows and don't care about having the bleeding-edge latest features, you can use the official Windows builds. This is by far the easiest setup method. Just download either a ZIP or 7Z file, unzip it and run the executable.

If you are not on Windows or you want the very latest features, you'll need to run SMEW Ship Radio Info Editor from source.


### How to Run SMEW Ship Radio Info Editor from Source

Download and install the following:
 * Python 3.6 (or newer) - http://www.python.org
 * PyQt 5.3 (or newer) - http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
 * cx_Freeze 4.3 (or newer) (optional) - http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net

Run the following in a command prompt:  
`python3 newer_credits_editor.py`  
You can replace `python3` with the path to python.exe (including "python.exe" at the end) and `newer_credits_editor.py` with the path to newer_credits_editor.py (including "newer_credits_editor.py" at the end)
